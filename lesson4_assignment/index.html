    <h1>Music's Impact on Society</h1> <!-- Page Title-->
    <h2><em>Overview</em></h2>
   
    <p>Music's impact on society is significant because it has been around for generations. Records of musicians and instruments can be traced back to as far as 4000 years ago. Music has the power to exert feelings that are personal, general, and popular! With different cultures expressing themselves through music, globalization takes place and allows more people to gain knowledge about music along with the corresponding culture.</p> <!-- Paragraph 1 -->
   
   <p>Classical music impact on society serves as audible medicine. Classical music is effective at lowering an indviduals blood pressure. There are also several studies that have been proven showing classical music helps ease symptoms of depression and melancholy. Not only does classical music help with your mood, but it helps boost your memory. Classical music increases brain wave activity that is directly linked to your memory. There have been multiple studies that show listening to classical music can help relieve physical pain. Patients who were recorded listening to classical music used significantly less pain medication.</p> <!-- Paragraph 2 -->
    
    <p>Music is not only used for entertainment purposes. It has been used as a tool and platform to single out the problems that are occuring in society. This is how the popular genre of rap music came into play. Artists such as Tupac Shakur, Notorious BIG, NWA, and more are all staple examples of using music to spread a bigger message about problems going on in the world. This is important because not everybody lived the same life however, with the power and spread of music, people were able to get a vivid painted picture of what is happening to those who did not have it as well off.</p> <!-- Paragraph 3 -->
    
    <p>The impact music brings to society is also utilized with celebrities and trends. For example, music is used in advertising usually with a well known face; that of a superstar. Quick jingles on advertisements can easily be stuck in one's head for hours which is basically the point. Now that jingle is asscoiated with the celebrity you saw with a connection directly to the car from the commercial. </p> <!-- Paragraph 4 -->
