		<p>The Beatles arrival on iTunes caused quite a stir in the media. Why? What's special about one band from the 60's? </p>
		<p>The Beatles' are recognized by many as the most successful pop group in history. In the decade that they made music, the band climbed from Liverpool poverty to world-wide acclaim. The band sold more albums in the U.S. than any other band prior or since. Billboard Magazine voted the band the "all-time hot-selling" number 1 artists. The Beatles won 7 Grammy Awards and enjoyed success and stardom the likes of few others. Now at long last the Apple Corps, which manages the Beatles' catalog (and not at all related to Apple Computers), has released all of it's Beatles' tracks and albums online in remastered digital glory, exclusively on iTunes. </p>
		<p>Why now? It is logical that Apple Corps was concerned about rampant pirating of the Beatles' digital property. It is likely that it took this long for the entire record industry to get comfortable with the idea of digital distribution. Apple iTunes is responsible for launching a new model of digital music distribution. Apple iTunes also worked out a special and secretive deal with Apple Corp. for splitting the revenue in a manner that makes it worth Apple Corp.'s while. </p>
		<p>The shift of music distribution channels from record store to Internet has caused a major disruption in the industry. The record companies have negotiated terms with distributors like Apple to sell tunes at a price that will make-up for illegal distribution channels (a side-effect of going digital). Streaming services like Spotify and Pandora have to include advertising revenues and premium memberships in their deals with record companies.</p>
		<p>Top Streaming Music Services</p>
		<ol>
  			<li>Pandora (31% marketshare)</li>
  			<li>iheartRadio (9%)</li>
  			<li>iTunes Radio (8%)</li>
  			<li>Spotify (6%)</li>
		</ol>
		<p>What impact does the Beatles transition to digital distribution have on the  music industry? An article in Reuters suggests that this provides a huge boost to digital music sales and marketing. While Apple trails in the music streaming market, it dominates the music sales market holding 75% share of worldwide digital music market Also, the Beatles and iTunes have also brought us back to the era of &quot;the album&quot; where songs are sold as collections to be listened to in sequence. The new partnership is an obvious win for both Apple Corp., and Apple Computers, but is it good for consumers? </p>
		<p>As a long standing die-hard Beatles fan, I am thrilled to have access to this music. However, I would prefer that the Beatles were released simultaneously across all digital music vendors. I don't like the fact that fans are required to use iTunes software to access Beatles' music. Even as a Mac user and an iTunes user, I resent Apple's continual control of digital content and manipulation of the public to make us dependent on the Apple platform for access to the world.</p>
